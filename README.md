# Dice Roller Using Python


# Dice Roller Project

This project is a simple Dice Roller implemented in Python with two different approaches, each offering a unique experience in terms of running and execution. The project is perfect for those looking to understand different ways of achieving the same goal using Python.

## Files

- **main.py**: This script rolls a dice and displays the result. It's straightforward, demonstrating the basic mechanics of rolling a dice.
  
- **duel.py**: This script offers a more interactive experience, possibly involving multiple dice or additional features, differing from the basic implementation in `main.py`.

## How to Run

1. **Running `main.py`:**
   - Simply run the script using Python.
   - Command: `python main.py`

2. **Running `duel.py`:**
   - This script may have additional features or require user interaction.
   - Command: `python duel.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required for this project.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` : Basic implementation of a dice roller.
- `duel.py` : An enhanced version of the dice roller with different execution and features.
